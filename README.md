- Demo & Snippets:

- Requirements:

 -This project is a basic front-end application with the following features:
    - Fetch and display a list of books related to flowers from the following REST API: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=flowers
    - Present the fetched data in a table, including book title, authors, and published date.
    - Enable users to view more details of a selected book, such as title, subtitle, authors, image, and description.

 -Additional Features that you could add once the MVP is done (but not limited to)
    - Sorting books by title, author, publish date
    - Book search
    - Add search history
    - favouriting books (could be done with redux)
    - books rating system (could be done with redux)
    - adding personal reviews to your books (could be done with redux)
    - using google books API collections features
    - Getting good reads links and displaying them on the page
    - Book form for submission for books you can't find in the API (react-hook-form)

 -Technology Recommendations (to get the most out of this project)
    - React
    - React Testing Library (always always always test everything you possibly can)
    - Typescript
    - Redux
    - React Query
    - Don't use an out of the box table library, build one yourself (break it down, scope it, build it)
    - Give tailwind a go, tip: have the docs open at all times

- Build Steps:
    - npm create vite@latest
