Google Books
    This project is a basic front-end application with the following features:
       - Fetch and display a list of books related to flowers from the following REST API: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=flowers
       - Present the fetched data in a table, including book title, authors, and published date.
       - Enable users to view more details of a selected book, such as title, subtitle, authors, image, and description.
       - Encourage the candidates to showcase their creativity and add a personal touch to the application.
       - Include a README file explaining the app's features and the creative elements introduced. (use the template in the post course repo)
    Additional Features that you could add once the MVP is done (but not limited to)
       - Sorting books by title, author, publish date
       - Book search
       - Add search history
       - favouriting books (could be done with redux)
       - books rating system (could be done with redux)
       - adding personal reviews to your books (could be done with redux)
       - using google books API collections features
       - Getting good reads links and displaying them on the page
       - Book form for submission for books you can't find in the API (react-hook-form)
Technology Recommendations (to get the most out of this project)
   - React
   - React Testing Library (always always always test everything you possibly can)
   - Typescript
   - Redux
   - React Query
   - Don't use an out of the box table library, build one yourself (break it down, scope it, build it)
   - Give tailwind a go, tip: have the docs open at all times
